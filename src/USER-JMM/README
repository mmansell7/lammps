This package contains implementations for LAMMPS of a number of
miscellaneous methods created by J. Matthew ("Matt") Mansell and
at North Carolina State University.

compute force/atom computes the total compressive force acting on
each atom in the simulation box, and stores this as a per-atom
vector.

For technical details, etc., see the following papers and 
presentations:

TBD

See the doc pages for these commands for details of how to use them
 in LAMMPS.

The person who created this package is J. Matthew ("Matt") Mansell
at NC State University ( jmmansel at ncsu.edu ). Contacted him if you
have questions.
